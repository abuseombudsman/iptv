Basically we distribute [Super Pomoyka](http://super-pomoyka.us.to/trash/ttv-list/) acestream and proxy lists for their service [Torrent TV](https://torrent-tv.ru) wich brings `online`  rusian tv in HD. Besides we struggle scraping some links for the [beIN](https://bein.com) live streams working some [Kodi](http://www.beinsports.com/en/) addons like Picasso and Zem TV.

Here in the [Super Pomoyka](http://super-pomoyka.us.to/trash/ttv-list/) page, you will find many list that work 100% and they are updated every day so the links works. For the acestreams you are encouraged to download the ace-player from [this](http://acestream.org) site for the streams to be played.

We specifically advise you to use the sport streams where you will be transported to a high new level of watching tv in HD. The downside is that you will never watch again tv streams in low resolution because now you know there is HD.
